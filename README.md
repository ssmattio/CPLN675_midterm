## CPLN 675 Midterm: Mapping Cases of Covid-19 by Date

The purpose of this project was to map the number of reported cases of Covid-19 through time. All data was derived from Corona Data Scraper (https://coronadatascraper.com/). To view the number of cases on a given day, click on the date. The map will change to reflect reported data for that date.
